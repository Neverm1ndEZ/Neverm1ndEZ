- 👋 Hi, I'm Mihir Suman also known as alias Neverm1ndEZ. Currently, a second year B.Tech Student enthusiatic about Android and Web Development
- 👀 My interest resides in Tech in general, be it talking about PC Builds or brainstorming ideas for a weekend project on any Tech Stack. 
- 🥱 I spend my leisure time making coffee, watching The Dark Knight and worrying about all the pending work that has to be done.
- ✅ I'm mostly comfortable with Java (for Android, can work with Kotlin too) and JavaScript (can work with TS) but I prefer calling myself a JS Dev cuz I always wanted to "introduce a little anarchy. Upsetting the established order and everything becomes chaos."
- 🌱 I’m currently applying my knowledge of Web and Android Development and building projects regarding the same.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Android/React Projects. Also, don't ask me to center a div or exit a vim, please 👉👈
- 📫 How to reach me: https://neverm1ndez.github.io/my-portfolio/ or throught twitter @nevermind_ez
