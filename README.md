- 👋 Hi, I'm Mihir Suman also known as alias Neverm1ndEZ. Currently, a Final-year B.Tech Student enthusiastic about Android and Web Development
- 👀 My interest resides in Tech in general, be it talking about PC Builds or brainstorming ideas for a weekend project on any Tech Stack. 
- 🥱 I spend my leisure time making coffee, watching The Dark Knight, and worrying about all the pending work that has to be done.
- ✅ I'm most comfortable with Java (or Kotlin) for Android and JavaScript (or TS). I prefer calling myself a JS Dev cuz I always wanted to "introduce a little anarchy which leads to upsetting the established order and everything becoming chaos."
- 🌱 I’m currently applying my knowledge of Web and Android Development and building projects regarding the same.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Android/React Projects. Also, open for Intern roles. Only request, don't ask me to center a div or exit a vim, please 👉👈
- 📫 How to reach me: https://neverm1ndez.github.io/my-portfolio/ or throught twitter @nevermind_ez
